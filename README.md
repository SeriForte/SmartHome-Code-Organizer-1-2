# SmartHome-Code-Organizer
An Flutter app to store Smart Home QR-Codes. The Codes can be saved as a PDF for a print.
This is the new Version of the **SmartHome-Code-Organizer** which was a necessary migration to Android 35. 

During the migration process some adjustments had to be made which include using JDK 17,
the new Android Studio Narwhal Feature Drop | 2025.1.2 (2025-08-02) and the new buidl.gradle.kts files.
